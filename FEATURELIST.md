# Feature List
**The Car Sales Project** must output to the Console (i.e. the Command Prompt using printf) and it must have the following features as a **minimum**:

- [ ] 4%: Looping Menu with 4 main actions:
  - [x] View Cars Stock,
  - [x] Buy Cars,
  - [x] View Sales Data, and
  - [ ] Customer Feedback. 
- [x] 5%: Must contain at least four arrays to store car information. A Car is defined by its price, model, and year of manufacture. The arrays should cover:
  - [x] Two for recording the price and model of a car
  - [x] One for recording the year of manufacture of each car
  - [x] One for recording the remaining amount of each car model
  - Note: you will randomly create/select your car information, whatever prices/models/years/amounts you wish, this data will not be given to you.
- [x] 5%: View Cars Stock will show a list of models, year of manufacture, and remaining amount
  - [ ] 4%: Sorted by year of manufacture in descending order
- [ ] 5%: Buying Cars needs to record the total price, customer name, customer age, if a discount was given, discount value, number of cars, and date of purchase. Update existing car arrays as necessary once a sale is concluded.
  - [ ] 4%: Any data being accepted from the keyboard needs to be validated and filtered (i.e. only accept correct data from the customer and keep asking until correct data is entered - see the Week 6 project DealingWithUserInput.zip for guidance)
- [ ] 5%: Sales Data for a Car Model is also displayed as a total sum for each model, in addition to displaying what each customer bought (e.g. BMW sold 5 units for a total of £50,000, Mercedes sold 4 units for a total of £40,000)
  - [ ] 4%: Sorted by total sale amount in descending order
- [ ] 5%: Sales Data is to be stored in a file
  - [ ] 4%: When the program launches, it should read previous sales data from the file, if it exists, to be used as initial data
- [ ] 5%: Customer Feedback: After a purchase, the customer can leave feedback (rating out of 5 and a short comment). This feedback should be stored and associated with the car model they purchased. 
- [ ] 15%: Make use of topics not taught in the module, but can be applied in a relevant way to this software project (do not include features/topics just for the sake of showing that you know how to use/implement it, instead consider why it will improve the software for the user) - e.g. dynamic memory allocation, file encryption for data protection 
- [ ] 5%: Your code needs to follow recommended coding standards and good practice (see Week 2)
- [ ] 20%: You MUST demonstrate your code in a short one to one discussion with your lab tutor. This will be arranged during the last 2 weeks of the module and it will be handled in a first-come-first-served manner i.e. there won't be a precise student demo schedule, just attend the lab session during the last 2 weeks and attempt to get time with the tutor. 
- [ ] 10%: Also submit a Logbook detailing:
  - [ ] a short essay reflecting on your own programming skills as they stand at the end of this module 
  - [ ] a plan of your personal development (soft and hard skills) over the next 2 years that will serve as a path to success as you will be approaching the end of your studies. 
    - Note: detailed guidance is provided below, please read this entire page.
